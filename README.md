# operating-systems-class

This project is for my operating systems class. The first project is to practice writing linux kernel modules.

To run this project, download files then run the "make" in the linux commandterminal. Then load the simple.ko module with the command "sudo insmod simple.ko". Results can be seen from the kernel log buffer with the command dmesg".  

Unload the module with the command "sudo rmmod simple".
